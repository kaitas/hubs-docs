## Share Room Dialog

The share room dialog gives you the information you need to share with others for them to join you in the room. You can use the numeric code to share a link verbally, share the current room URL or the shortened hub.link URL. Note that codes expire after 72 hours.

A checkbox on the invite dialog allows you to sign up for notifications that alert you when another user has entered the room. You can sign up for notifications on your phone or desktop. You do not need to remain in the room to receive notifications.
